Code to analyse the relationship between ecosystem service robustness to loss of species and our proposed network fragility metric. The analysis is conducted on simulations on the published [http://www.web-of-life.es](Web of Life) ecological networks of varying type. The associated research paper for this is currently in review (__*insert link and reference when available*__). 

The analysis consists of a main file "empirical-networks-analysis.Rmd" that contains the various functions we define in the associated paper, alongside the code to apply it to the suite of empirical networks. The folder "data/" contains the original data as downloaded from the [http://www.web-of-life.es](Web of Life). The folder "images/" contains printed figures from the analysis. The folder "export/" is empty by default but the code can be edited to export csv copies of the data to this folder if required. This code is released with a GNU General Public License v3.
