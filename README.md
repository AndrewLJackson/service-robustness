# service-robustness

Code to analyse the relationship between ecosystem service robustness to loss of species and our proposed network fragility metric. The analysis is conducted on simulations on the published [http://www.web-of-life.es](Web of Life) ecological networks of varying type. The associated research paper for this is currently in review (__*insert link and reference when available*__).
